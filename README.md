Convict Conditioning bodyweight training tracking system for technically inclinde people who don't want to spend $30.

Dragondoor, the publisher of the famed Convict Conditioning bodyweight training system, is publishing a workout journal for tracking ones progress for around $30 (http://www.dragondoor.com/shop-by-department/books/b67/?F_All=Y). I am a practioner of the programs, but I am not dropping $30 on a training journal. My typical training journal is a Tops engineering computation pad that I can get for around $8 (or cheaper through Amazon), and I can use that to track other exercises. But a dedicated training journal could be useful I thought. So I started to build a site with DJango to do just that. But I allowed my self to get side tracked (I added other excerises to my training regimen) and I once again struggled with the concept of a dedicated site to a program. So instead, I decided to post the tools I wrote to model the system as I built it out, but instead of a wide audience that the DJango-powered site would have targetted, these tools will target the individual.
